1863), or under section 92 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), the Court trying such suit
may, if, on application of the plaintiff and after hearing the defendant and making such inquiry as it
thinks fit, it is satisfied that such an order is necessary in the public interest, direct the defendant either
to furnish security for any expenditure incurred or likely to be incurred by the plaintiff in instituting
and maintaining such suit, or to deposit from any money in his hands as trustee of the trust to which
the suit relates such sum as such Court considers sufficient to meet such expenditure in whole or in
part. (2) When any money has been deposited in accordance with an order made under subsection (1),
the Court may make over to the plaintiff the whole or any part of such sum for the conduct of the suit.
Before making over any sum to the plaintiff, the Court shall take security from the plaintiff for the
refund of the same in the event of such refund being subsequently ordered by the Court. Previous Next
